# Chip 8 
I present a very bad chip-8 interpreter written in C.

It did surprisingly well on the test I performed on it.



The reference taken for this are:
- my own python chip8 implementation (this is a very unorganized and slow interpreter since i tried to create it in a day)
- Cowdog's Chip - 8 technical reference - http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM
